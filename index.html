   <p>Set Up: Place 4 stones in each of the 12 round spaces. Leave the larger ovals (called the ‘Store’) empty. Color does not
    matter.
    The Game: Roll a die to see who goes first (higher number).
    First player chooses a circle on their own side, picks up the stones in that space, and starting with the next space, drops
    one stone in each space going counterclockwise (including the Store) until all of the stones are played out.
    Now it is the other player’s turn to do the same using stones on their side and continuing to play counterclockwise.
    Note: if there are enough stones to reach the other player’s Store, skip that space and continue on your own.
    If your last stone goes into your Store, you get to go again.*
    If your last stone goes into an empty space on your side, move that stone and any captured stones ( those directly across
    on your opponent’s side) to your Store.*
    The game ends when either player has no more stones in their six circles. The remaining stones go to the other player’s
    Store.
    The winner is the player with the most stones in their Store.
